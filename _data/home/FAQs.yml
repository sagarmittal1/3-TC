FAQ:
  - question: What technical writing tools should I learn?
    answer:   In general, learn markup and style languages more than a specific tool, since languages have a more widespread application than specific tools. The most useful markup and style languages are HTML, XML, and CSS. You can find resources to learn these languages online.

             For specific tools, look at http://indeed.com for technical writer jobs in your area. 
             After analyzing the job postings, try to identify a common trend in the tools required.
              Learn those tools. You can also review commonly used tools from previous WritersUA tool surveys.

          In general, learn these four types of tools:

            Help authoring tools (such as Jekyll, MadCap Flare, Confluence, Robohelp, Doc-to-Help, or some other)
            Graphics tools (Snagit, Capture, Photoshop, Illustrator)
            Video recording tools (Camtasia Studio, Screenflow, Captivate)
            Page layout tool (InDesign, Word, Framemaker)


 -  question: I’m interested in technical writing, but isn’t it boring?
     answer: No, technical writing isn’t boring. It actually taps into quite a few creative skills, 
     but that creativity isn’t creativity so much in writing. It’s more like creativity in problem solving, 
     layout and design, finding ways to illustrate concepts, 
     and in thinking through ways that people might use the product.

      In addition to using these creative skills, you’ll be immersed in an environment full of interaction designers,
       engineers, quality assurance testers, project managers, analysts, corporate communications teams, and more.
        In short, IT departments can be energetic, cool places to work.
